` //define the RST_DFF macro this is the PC reg.
define RST_DFF(q, d, clk, rst)                       //"define" creates a macro named RST_DFF

**macro**
 is a reusable code snippet that can be expanded anywhere in the code. Think of it as a shortcut for commonly used code patterns.

 **"Always_ff Block"**  
  synchronous sequential logic. defines a flip-flop The block is executed whenever the clock ticks (a rising edge occurs) or when the reset signal is asserted (goes high).

**Sequential Logic:**  
<=  : This is a non-blocking assignment operator, used in sequential logic (for always_comb well use = ).  
Non-blocking assignments ensure that all right-hand-side evaluations are done before left-hand-side updates in the current simulation time step.  
(rst) ? 0 : d   : (condition ? true_value : false_value).  
If rst is high (1), q is assigned 0.
If rst is low (0), q is assigned the value of d.

**module**  
Modules are the building blocks in SystemVerilog used to represent hardware components or subsystems.

**typedef**  
is used to define new data types in SystemVerilog. It allows you to create aliases for existing data types or define custom data types. 

**logic**  
is a data type in SystemVerilog used to represent digital signals. It can take on four values: 0, 1, X (unknown), and Z (high impedance).

**enum**  
gives a name to each value in a list of values. It is used to create a user-defined data type with a fixed set of values.   nottttttttt sure i like this explanation

**Summary of the Difference**  
|Feature |typedef| enum |
|------|-------|-------|    
|Purpose |	Create a new name for a type|	Define a set of named constant values|
|Assign Values|	No | Yes, assigns specific values
|Reusability|	Makes code more readable and reusable|Provides meaningful names for numbers|

**i_mem**  
defined in byte (8 bit) such that i_mem[0] = is the first byte, and i_mem[1]= second byte. so when we want a command (32 bit = 4 byte) we can use concatination {} OR 4 calls to i_mem.

**assign**  
its like a wire (combinatorial-meaning output changes immediately when input changes.) 
for example: assign c = a & b ; //AND gate

**(=) OR (==)**  
***single equals sign (=)***
is used for procedural assignments within always blocks (e.g., always_ff, always_comb).  
It means "assign this value" or "update this variable."  
example:    a = b + c; // Assigns the result of b + c to a  

***Double == (Equality Comparison):***  
The double equals sign (==) is used for comparison.  
It checks whether two values are equal and returns 1 (true) if they are, or 0 (false) if they are not.  
example:   assign result = (a == b); // result = 1 if a equals b, otherwise 0 

`assign ALUOp = (opcode == R_TYPE) ? 2'b10 :  // R-type instructions
               (opcode == BEQ)    ? 2'b01 :  // Branch instructions
               (opcode == LW || opcode == SW || opcode == ADDI) ? 2'b00 :  // Load/Store/ADDI
               2'b00; // Default to ADD for safety `  

How It Works :  (condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;  

If opcode matches R_TYPE, assigns a 2-bit binary value (10) to ALUOp for R-type instructions.
Value if False: Moves to the next conditional branch...  
  
| **Condition**         | **Description**    | **ALUOp Value** |
|-----------------------|------------------- |-----------------|
| `opcode == R_TYPE`    | R-type instructions (e.g., ADD, SUB) | `2'b10`    |
| `opcode == BEQ`     | Branch instructions     | `2'b01`       |
| `opcode == LW || opcode == SW || opcode == ADDI` | Load/Store/Immediate instructions    | `2'b00`         |
| Default (none of the above conditions match)  | Default to ADD operation (safety)    | `2'b00`         |
  

` assign sign_extended_imm = {{16{instruction[15]}}, instruction[15:0]}; //sign extension`  

**{{ 16{instruction[15]} }}:**  
Replication operator: {{n{value}}} replicates value n times.  
Here, {16{instruction[15]}} creates a 16-bit vector where every bit is equal to the value of instruction[15].

**{{16{instruction[15]}}, instruction[15:0]}:**  
This concatenates two parts:  
{{16{instruction[15]}}}: The replicated MSB for the upper 16 bits.
instruction[15:0]: The original 16-bit value.

### **Register File Write Logic**  
This block handles selecting and updating a specific register in the register file based on control signals and input data.

#### **Code Overview**
```verilog
// Determine which register to write to (mux for write register)
assign write_ptr = RegDst ? rd : rt;

// Combinational logic to handle register file write
always_comb begin : rf_write
    next_registers = registers; // Default: Copy current register file state
    if (RegWrite) begin
        next_registers[write_ptr] = write_data_reg; // Update selected register
    end
end
```

#### **Key Details**
1. **`write_ptr`**:
   - A 5-bit signal that determines which of the 32 registers to write to.
   - Selected using a multiplexer:
     - `RegDst = 1`: Write to register `rd`.
     - `RegDst = 0`: Write to register `rt`.

2. **`always_comb` Block**:
   - Ensures combinational logic for writing to the register file:
     - **Default Assignment**: `next_registers = registers;` ensures all registers retain their current values unless explicitly updated.
     - **Conditional Update**: If `RegWrite` is active, the value in `write_data_reg` is written to the register indexed by `write_ptr`.

3. **Why Use `always_comb`?**
   - Guarantees **pure combinational behavior** (no latches or flip-flops).
   - Automatically includes all signals (`RegWrite`, `write_ptr`, etc.) in the sensitivity list, reducing the risk of simulation mismatches.
   - Ensures no unintended latches are inferred by requiring all conditions to be handled explicitly.

#### **Functionality Summary**
- Selects the register to write (`write_ptr`) based on the control signal `RegDst`.
- Updates the selected register only if `RegWrite` is enabled.
- Preserves the state of all other registers.
